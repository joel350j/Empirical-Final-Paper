AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus incidence has more than doubled in the U.S. over 
      the past 2 decades. Not all sectors of the population have experienced the 
      increase proportionally. The goal of this study was to determine if disparities 
      in diabetes by education and race/ethnicity have increased over time, and if 
      there are differences by gender and birth cohort. METHODS: Repeated 
      cross-sectional data were used from the 1973-2012 National Health Interview 
      Survey of adults aged 25-84 years. Logistic regression models were run and 
      predicted probabilities were calculated to determine if disparities in 
      self-reported diabetes by education and race/ethnicity changed over time, by 
      gender and birth cohort (birth before 1946, 1946-1970, 1971 or after). Analyses 
      were conducted in 2014-2015. RESULTS: Relationships between education or 
      race/ethnicity and diabetes were modified by time for people born before 1971, 
      with stronger effect modification for women than men. Inequalities in diabetes 
      prevalence grew over time, although the magnitude of disparities was smaller for 
      the 1946-1970 cohort. For example, in 2005-2012, the gap in diabetes prevalence 
      for women with the highest and lowest levels of education was 12.7% for pre-1946 
      versus 7.9% for 1946-1970. Similar trends were seen for differences between 
      non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks or Hispanics. Results were 
      inconclusive for the youngest cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes disparities are 
      evident. Smaller differences in later cohorts may indicate that large structural 
      changes in society (e.g., Civil Rights movement, increased educational and 
      economic opportunities) have benefited later generations.
